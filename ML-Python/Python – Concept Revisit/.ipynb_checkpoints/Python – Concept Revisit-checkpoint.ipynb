    "#### Download Python:\n",
    "    -Go to the official Python website.\n",
    "    -Click on the \"Downloads\" tab.\n",
    "    -Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Run the Installer:\n",
    "    -Open the downloaded installer file.\n",
    "    -Make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\" before clicking \"Install Now\".\n",
    "    -Follow the installation prompts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 2: Verify the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Command Prompt:\n",
    "    -Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.\n",
    "    -In the Command Prompt, type python --version and press Enter. You should see the version of Python you installed.\n",
    "    -Also, check pip (Python's package installer) by typing pip --version.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a Virtual Environment:\n",
    "    -Open Command Prompt.\n",
    "    -Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. For example, cd C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Projects.\n",
    "    -Run python -m venv myenv to create a virtual environment named myenv.\n",
    "#### Activate the Virtual Environment:\n",
    "    -On Windows, run myenv\\Scripts\\activate.\n",
    "    -On macOS and Linux, run source myenv/bin/activate.\n",
    "    -You should see (myenv) at the beginning of your command prompt line, indicating the virtual environment is active.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 3: Install Packages\n",
    "    -With the virtual environment activated, you can install packages using pip. For example, to install numpy, type pip         install numpy.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Install Jupyter Notebook (Optional but Recommended):\n",
    " \n",
    "    -Activate Your Virtual Environment\n",
    "    -Open Command Prompt.\n",
    "    -Navigate to your project directory and activate your virtual environment\n",
    "    -Install Jupyter Notebook(By command :-\"pip install jupyter\"\n",
    "    -Launch Jupyter Notebook(By command:-\"jupyter notebook\")\n",
    "##### Create a New Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where you want to create your notebook.\n",
    "    -Click on the \"New\" button on the right and select \"Python 3\" from the dropdown menu. This will create a new notebook.\n",
    "    -Use the Notebook:\n",
